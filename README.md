# Wu-Project

This is a project that contains three different codes that work on images in C++. This is the work that I've done for my computing science course. The main task for me while I was doing this project was to learn how to use classes in C++ and the differences between C++ and C.

## Installation

Prerequisites:
To use this code you will need a text editor and a compiler that will work with C++.

Installing:
It is very easy to install this. You just have to download these files and run them on your computer.

## Usage

You can use these functions to work with arrays that represent images.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
